## Purpose

This code (the original version) was written in about 2-3 minutes as *scott* was playing around using the new projector system where we host the [Atlanta.pm](http://atlanta.pm.org/) meetings.

The secondary purpose and why we can use it over/over again is to make the standard announcements.  But also make it flexible enough we can add announcements on a single meeting basis without having to write the whole thing each time.

## WARNING

This is **REALLY BAD CODE**.

This is put up on GitHub so Bruce (util) can use it as an example of bad code.

## updates

We have updated the code a few times.  the orignal code with cleanup updates in it, is in the "simple" folder.

A new one with external file(s) for the input of the "announcements" and has customizable width of the display.

A new folder called "bad_bad_code" has the original really bad code in it.
