Purpose
=======

This code (the original version) was written in about 2-3 minutes as *scott* was playing around using the new projector system where we host the [Atlanta.pm](http://atlanta.pm.org/) meetings.

The secondary purpose and why we can use it over/over again is to make the standard announcements.  But also make it flexible enough we can add announcements on a single meeting basis without having to write the whole thing each time.

WARNING
=======

This is **REALLY BAD CODE**.

This is put up on GitHub so Bruce (util) can use it as an example of bad code.
